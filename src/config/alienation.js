  intro: "Parental alienation \u2014 when one parent actively turns a child against the other parent or stepparent \u2014 is a specific and severe dynamic that goes beyond typical stepfamily adjustment. If you're experiencing this, it's important to know that standard stepparenting strategies may not apply.",
  signs: [
    "The child repeats word-for-word phrases that sound like an adult's language, not a child's",
    "Rejection escalated suddenly after contact with the other parent, with no other trigger",
    "The child shows no ambivalence \u2014 they're entirely negative with zero mixed feelings",
    "Previously warm interactions disappeared overnight",
    "The child makes false accusations or dramatically rewrites shared history",
  ],

    { title: "This is not your fault", text: "Alienation is a form of psychological manipulation by an adult. No amount of 'trying harder' on your part will fix it, because the problem isn't coming from you or the child." },
    { title: "Document, don't react", text: "Keep factual records of what the child says and when. Your StepStrong entries can serve this purpose. Note specific phrases, dates, and context \u2014 especially correlation with custody transitions." },
    { title: "Protect the relationship you can", text: "Focus on your relationship with your partner. Alienation puts enormous strain on couples. Your partner needs to be actively involved in addressing this \u2014 it cannot be your fight alone." },
    { title: "Seek specialized help", text: "General stepfamily advice often doesn't apply to alienation. Look for therapists who specifically work with parental alienation or high-conflict custody situations." },
    { title: "Lower your expectations without giving up", text: "Progress in alienation cases is measured differently. A child maintaining any neutral contact at all may be the realistic best outcome while the alienation is active. This doesn't mean forever." },
  ],
  note: "StepStrong's tracking tools can still be useful in alienation situations \u2014 documenting patterns, correlating behaviors with custody transitions, and maintaining your own perspective. But the perspective cards and benchmarks are designed for typical stepfamily resistance, not active alienation. If you're in this situation, please adjust your expectations of this app and of yourself.",
