export const PARTNER_TIPS = [
  {
    title: "Make the invisible visible",
    situation: "Your partner doesn't seem to notice your efforts with their child.",
    tip: "Don't wait for them to notice. Share specific moments: 'I made their lunch today and they walked past me without a word. I know that's normal, but it would help me to hear that you see what I'm doing.'",
    why: "Partners often assume stepparents know their efforts are appreciated. They don't realize you need explicit acknowledgment because you're not getting any from the child.",
  },
  {
    title: "The united front conversation",
    situation: "You feel undermined when your partner overrides your decisions in front of the child.",
    tip: "Try: 'When we disagree about rules, can we talk about it privately first? When it happens in front of the kids, it signals that I don't have authority here \u2014 and that makes it harder for them to respect me.'",
    why: "Children in stepfamilies are highly attuned to power dynamics. If they see the bio-parent override the stepparent, it confirms their belief that the stepparent doesn't count.",
  },
  {
    title: "Don't compete with the other parent",
    situation: "Your partner compares you to the child's other biological parent, or expects you to fill that role.",
    tip: "Say: 'I'm not trying to replace anyone. I'm trying to build my own relationship with your child. That takes time, and it will look different from what they have with their other parent \u2014 and that's okay.'",
    why: "Stepparents who try to replicate the bio-parent role face the most resistance. Research consistently shows that a 'friendly mentor' role leads to better outcomes than a 'replacement parent' role.",
  },
  {
    title: "When you need space from the child",
    situation: "You need a break but feel guilty asking.",
    tip: "Try: 'I need an hour to reset after today. That's not me giving up \u2014 it's me making sure I can show up again tomorrow. Can you handle bedtime tonight?'",
    why: "Stepparent burnout is real and under-discussed. Taking breaks isn't abandonment. Partners need to understand that sustained effort requires recovery.",
  },
  {
    title: "Sharing your StepStrong data",
    situation: "Your partner asks how things are going, and you want to show them \u2014 not just tell them.",
    tip: "Use the monthly report to share patterns: 'Look \u2014 when I use quiet acts of service, the response is neutral or positive 70% of the time. Direct conversation only works 30%. This is real data, not just my feelings.'",
    why: "Data removes the emotion from the conversation. Your partner can see objective patterns instead of hearing what might sound like complaints.",
  },
  {
    title: "When your partner says 'just give it time'",
    situation: "You're struggling and your partner minimizes it with 'they'll come around.'",
    tip: "Respond: 'I hear you, and I know time matters. But right now, I need you to acknowledge that this is hard \u2014 not solve it, just see it. Can you just sit with me in this for a minute?'",
    why: "'Give it time' feels dismissive even when it's true. What stepparents need in the moment is validation, not advice. Partners often default to fixing because the pain is uncomfortable to witness.",
  },
  {
    title: "Asking for backup without starting a fight",
    situation: "The child was disrespectful to you and your partner didn't intervene.",
    tip: "Wait until you're calm, then: 'When [specific thing] happened today and nothing was said, I felt unsupported. I'm not asking you to punish them \u2014 I'm asking you to say something in the moment, even something small, so they know that's not okay.'",
    why: "Bio-parents often freeze when caught between their child and their partner. They need specific, small requests \u2014 not general demands to 'do something.'",
  },
  {
    title: "The loyalty conflict isn't about you",
    situation: "Your partner's child acts worse after visits with their other parent.",
    tip: "Tell your partner: 'I've noticed the pattern too. It's not about us doing something wrong \u2014 they're processing loyalty conflict. The best thing we can do is keep things calm and predictable when they come back.'",
    why: "Children often act out after custody transitions because they feel guilty for enjoying time with the other household. Naming this pattern together reduces blame.",
  },
